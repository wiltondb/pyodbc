# Babelfish patch

`babelfish` branch in this fork includes a patch with a workaround to
[sp_describe_undeclared_parameters problem](https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgresql/babelfish_extensions/issues/1354)
that happens when PyODBC is used with [Babelfish for PostgreSQL](https://babelfishpg.org/).

With this change `SQLDescribeParam` is NOT used by default for `None` arguments. To restore original behaviour new 
`use_describeparam_for_none=True` argument needs to be specified to `pyodbc.connect()` call.

# Original readme

pyodbc is an open source Python module that makes accessing ODBC databases simple.  It
implements the [DB API 2.0](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249) specification but is
packed with even more Pythonic convenience.

The easiest way to install pyodbc is to use pip:

    pip install pyodbc

On Macs, you should probably install unixODBC first if you don't already have an ODBC
driver manager installed, e.g. using `Homebrew`:

    brew install unixodbc
    pip install pyodbc

Similarly, on Unix you should make sure you have an ODBC driver manager installed before
installing pyodbc.  See the [docs](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/wiki/Install)
for more information about how to do this on different Unix flavors.  (On Windows, the
ODBC driver manager is built-in.)

Precompiled binary wheels are provided for multiple Python versions on most Windows, macOS,
and Linux platforms.  On other platforms pyodbc will be built from the source code.  Note,
pyodbc contains C++ extensions so when building from source you will need a suitable C++
compiler.  See the [docs](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/wiki/Install) for details.

[Release Notes](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/releases)

IMPORTANT: Python 2.7 support is being ended.  The pyodbc 4.x versions will be the last to
support Python 2.7.  The pyodbc 5.x versions will support only Python 3.7 and above.
